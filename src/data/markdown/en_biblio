Books
*Gravity* by Steve Paxton, Contredanse Éditions, Bruxelles, 2018.
In this book, the dancer Steve Paxton traces a lifetime in the company of gravity. The memory of his first flight, a meditation on walking, pondering on the conditions of life, and a dream of dancing make up pieces of a puzzle. Paxton muses about the limit of his consciousness and celebrates the potentiality of our senses to enter the dance.
